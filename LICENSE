This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2.1, which can be found in the file "doc/LGPL". I reserve the right to place future versions of this library under a different license. http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want, but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those must be released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted back to the pygame project). Closed source and commercial games are fine. The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public domain.
